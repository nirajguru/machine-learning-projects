# Personal Loan Compaign

## Problem Statement
There are lot of customers who are having deposit accounts with the bank. However, they are not taking any personal loans. The bank wants to increase personal loan customers so that they can make more money.

## Objective
To identify customers who would take personal loans

## Plan
As this is a classification problem where the customer class (whether a customer will take loan or not) has to be identified, we will use logistic regression and decision tree models to identify this customer class. We will score the models and choose the best model.
